## Why you should care about development containers

&nbsp;

When someone new joins your project team, how long do they need until every tool is installed and they can run code on their development machine?

&nbsp;

How much do the development setups of your different engineers differ?
How long is your setup guide documentation?

&nbsp;

“Works on my machine” is less of a problem these days if the application you’re developing is containerized.
But what about the tools and configurations you need to develop your application which live outside of your application container?

## GitHub Codespaces

&nbsp;

What if you want to separate your development environment from your machine completely?

&nbsp;

With development containers, you can use the power of containerization for your whole setup: Configure one file and have developers spin up a container with everything preinstalled so that they can focus on what matters: Developing your product.

&nbsp;

GitHub has been a front runner in this domain with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces): Combined with Visual Studio Code (in the browser or locally), you can open a fully featured IDE from any public GitHub repository by logging into GitHub and pressing “.”.

&nbsp;

To standardize these development container configurations, Microsoft has created an open specification at [Development containers](https://containers.dev/).

## Alternatives

&nbsp;

Apart from Microsoft / GitHub, there are also other providers of similar services like [Coder](https://coder.com/), which we recently investigated at one of our customers as an option to improve their development setup.

&nbsp;

With Coder, you can set up development containers as terraform templates, which the developers can then invoke via a user-friendly web UI and then connect to from their favorite tool like Visual Studio Code.

&nbsp;

Coder, in contrast to GitHub Codespaces, is run on your own on-prem or public cloud infrastructure, so you can use it independently of where you’re hosting your code.

Coder has a very usable self-service UI to provision dev containers.
